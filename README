What is this?
	This is an editor to edit otb files which holds important information 
about items.


How does it work?
	Copy the files tibia.dat and tibia.spr from your Tibia 7.9 directory 
to where you extracted OTItemEditor. Then load your items.otb or download latest from
http://opentibia.cvs.sourceforge.net/opentibia/otserv/data/items/items.otb?view=log.
